# Discord React Clone

This project is a front-end replication of Discord's app made with React. This is not a full replication so I added the most used parts of the app.

The main objective of this project was to learn React hooks and `styled-components` (so aside from normalize.css, this is the only library utilized).

Some observations:
* The styled scrollbars only work on webkit-based browsers
* As it is a front-end only project, all the data is mocked in a single file
* I don't have the official font that Discord utilizes so I utilized Catamaran instead, it is not very similar but isn't so bad
* All arts (except the cats) were extracted from the official app, all the rights belong to Discord

## Running the project

    npm start
    # or
    yarn start

This will run the app in development mode, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
